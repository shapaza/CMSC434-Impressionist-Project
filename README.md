This program is a drawing app which allows users to create pseudo-impressionist drawings of selected images. Currently, it allows its users to:
- Load images from the Android device's image gallery.
- Draw on a blank canvas using three different brush types, including a square brush, circle brush, and a motion-based circle brush which changes size depending on the velocity of mouse or finger movement.
- Invert the color of the brush, such that each brush stroke will paint the complimentary color of the selected image.
- Save these drawings to the Android device's image gallery.
- Clear the drawing canvas.
